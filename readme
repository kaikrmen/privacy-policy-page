# 📄 Privacy Policy Page

This project includes a dedicated **Privacy Policy** page located at:

```
[http://localhost:3000/privacy-policy]
```

This page is created using the **App Router** in Next.js 13+ and supports static or dynamic content as needed.

## 🌐 Multilingual Notice

This privacy policy page can be written in **English**, **Spanish**, or both, depending on your target audience or localization strategy.

## 📁 File Structure

```

/app
└── privacy-policy
└── page.tsx     → Main privacy policy page
/layout.tsx               → App layout
/globals.css              → Global styles

```

---

## ✏️ Editing the Content

You can update the text by editing:

```

/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx

```

We recommend keeping a clear structure with headings such as:

- Introduction
- Information Collected
- Usage of Data
- User Rights
- Cookies Policy
- Contact

---

## 🚀 Redirection Setup

When the app starts at `/`, it automatically redirects to the privacy policy page (`/privacy-policy`).

This is handled in:

```

/app/page.tsx

````

With this content:

```tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Home() {
  redirect('/privacy-policy');
}
````

## 📌 Notes

* You can integrate your real privacy content in Markdown, JSON, CMS or API.
* For production, remember to update all legal texts based on your business type and jurisdiction.
